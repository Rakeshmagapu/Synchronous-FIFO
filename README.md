# 🗂️ Synchronous FIFO Design (Verilog)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the **Verilog RTL design** and **testbench** for a **Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** memory.  
A FIFO is a widely used buffer in digital systems, ensuring that data is read in the same order it was written.  

The project demonstrates:
- ✅ Parameterized synchronous FIFO design  
- ✅ Verilog testbench for functional verification  
- ✅ Simulation of enqueue (write) and dequeue (read) operations  
- ✅ Overflow and underflow condition checks

## ⚙️ Features
- Synchronous read and write operations  
- Configurable depth and width  
- FIFO full and empty flag generation  
- Testbench validates different scenarios
